/**An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
observed by an event subscription or delivered asynchronously to
the target location of an active webhook.

The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the
subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B
modified it, the eventâ€™s user will be user B. Note: Some events
are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API
consumers should make sure to handle this case.

The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one
that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For
example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks
contained within the project.

**Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields
`Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.
`Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource
itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information
within the resource's fields have been modified.

For instance, consider these scenarios:


* When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be
`added`, `Event.parent` will be an object with the `id` and
`type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.


* When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be
`null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
`Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will
be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.


* When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will
be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
`Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be
an object with the user's `id` and `type`.*/
